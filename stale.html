            <p>Mario from One Installation Inc came to give me an estimate for surveillance cameras. He not only gave me an estimate but informed me on how I could improve the quality of the picture. Prices were very affordable! I ended up having One Installation Inc install my cameras as well as a few TVs. They were very cautious with not only my belongings but also with everyoneâ€™s health and well being. They came in wearing gloves, boot covers and mask. One Installation Inc did a great job! I highly recommend using One Installation Inc!</p>

            <p>Mario and his team were fantastic! The customer service was impeccable. I had cameras installed in my new home, they work great. They communicated in a timely fashion and answered all my questions I had. They arrived on time, they were neat, and very professional. They take great pride in their work. I highly recommend Mario and his team!</p>

            <p>Mario and his team , did an excellent installation at my new home, I was very worried that moving to a new home and a new area would be worrying for me and my family, luckily my neighbor made a call to his guy and Mario (the owner) personally came to my home along with his tech, to walk the property and make me suggestions. After a few days I was installed and secured at my new home. Very professional and quick to answer any of my questions or concerns.  Thanks Mario regards worry free customer for life.</p>
