             <p>Mario from One Installation Inc came to give me an estimate for surveillance cameras. He not only gave me an estimate but informed me on how I could improve the quality of the picture. Prices were very affordable! I ended up having One Installation Inc install my cameras as well as a few TVs. They were very cautious with not only my belongings but also with everyone’s health and well being. They came in wearing gloves, boot covers and mask. One Installation Inc did a great job! I highly recommend using One Installation Inc!</p>

             <p>I started working as a GM of a property and needed to get the security cameras back up and running (after the change in management/password issues) and Mario and the guys at One Installation Inc were great! They came out the next day and completely reset our system for us! They even got 2 cameras to work that were never connected before and helped us set up apps on our phones so we could connect from anywhere! Thanks Mario! You guys ROCK!</p>

             <p>Mario and his team were fantastic! The customer service was impeccable. I had cameras installed in my new home, they work great. They communicated in a timely fashion and answered all my questions I had. They arrived on time, they were neat, and very professional. They take great pride in their work. I highly recommend Mario and his team!</p>

             <p>Mario and his team , did an excellent installation at my new home, I was very worried that moving to a new home and a new area would be worrying for me and my family, luckily my neighbor made a call to his guy and Mario (the owner) personally came to my home along with his tech, to walk the property and make me suggestions. After a few days I was installed and secured at my new home. Very professional and quick to answer any of my questions or concerns.  Thanks Mario regards worry free customer for life.</p>
